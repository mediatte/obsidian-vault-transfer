3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins

### From Community Plugins (Coming Soon)

Search for "Vault Transfer" in the Community Plugins tab.

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Vault Transfer
2. Add target vault paths by clicking "Add Path"
3. Configure your preferences:
   - Include attachments
   - Preserve metadata
   - Default action (copy or move)
   - Conflict handling method

### Transfer Methods

#### Method 1: Command Palette
- Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on Mac)
- Search for "Transfer" or "Move"
- Choose your preferred action

#### Method 2: Ribbon Icon
- Click the transfer icon in the ribbon
- Choose between copy or move in the modal

#### Method 3: Right-click Menu
- Right-click on any file in the file explorer
- Select "Transfer to another vault" or "Move to another vault"

### Transfer vs Move

- **Transfer (Copy)**: Creates a copy in the target vault, keeps the original
- **Move**: Copies to target vault and deletes the original file

## Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Target Vault Paths | List of other vault folders to transfer files to | Empty |
| Include Attachments | Transfer linked images and files | Enabled |
| Preserve Metadata | Keep original creation/modification dates | Enabled |
| Delete After Transfer | Default action: move (true) or copy (false) | Copy |
| Conflict Handling | What to do when file already exists | Rename |

## Conflict Handling Options

- **Rename**: Adds a number suffix (e.g., "note (1).md")
- **Overwrite**: Replaces the existing file
- **Skip**: Cancels the transfer for that file

## Requirements

- Obsidian v0.15.0 or higher
- Desktop only (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Write permissions to target vault folders

## Limitations

- **Desktop only**: Does not work on mobile devices
- **File system access**: Requires direct access to vault folders
- **Obsidian Sync**: Use Obsidian Sync for mobile vault synchronization instead

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Won't Load
- Check that all three files (main.js, manifest.json, styles.css) are in the plugin folder
- Verify the plugin is enabled in Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
- Check the developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I) for error messages

### Can't Add Target Vault
- Ensure you have write permissions to the target folder
- Try selecting the root vault folder (containing .obsidian folder)
- Check that the path doesn't contain special characters

### Files Not Transferring
- Verify target vault path is correct
- Check available disk space
- Ensure target vault is not currently open in another Obsidian instance
